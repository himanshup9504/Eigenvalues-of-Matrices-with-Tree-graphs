	abstract = {When the undirected graph of a real square matrix is a tree of forest, we establish finitely computable tests yielding information about the magnitudes and multiplicities to the eigenvalues of the matrix. Applying these tests to system designs expressed as signed directed graphs can be sufficient to guarantee controllability of the associated linear dynamical systems.}

	abstract = {This paper provides a finitely computable graph-theoretic answer to the following question concerning linear dynamical systems: When, given only the signs of entries (+, -, or 0) in a real square matrix A, can one be certain that all positive trajectories of the system ẋ = Ax are bounded? Matrices having such sign-patterns are called sign-quasistable. With “bounded” replaced by “convergent to the origin,” the matrices are called sign-stable and were fully described in earlier papers. However, when A's digraph has several strong components, so that the system is actually a hierarchy of subsystems, and when some of those subsystems fail to be sign-stable, the recognition of sign-quasistability is a very delicate matter. By means of certain graph color tests, it is possible to identify the system variables that are capable (for some choice of matrix-entry magnitudes and initial conditions) of emitting nonzero constant}
